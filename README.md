Title: Hangman

Description:
Hangman is a new spin on an old classic.  The basic premise of the game is for users to guess letters and try to uncover a hidden word before their man is hung.  The game features two modes of game play: user-entered words or random words from a selected category.  In the user-entered word mode, the user will enter the word to be used on the screen.  In the second mode, the user can choose from a list of categories and a random word related to that category will be selected.
