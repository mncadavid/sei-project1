Title: Hackman

Description:

Hackman is a new spin on an old classic.  The basic premise of the game is for users to guess letters and try to uncover a hidden word before their robot is fully built.  The game features two modes of game play: user-entered words or random words from a selected category.  In the user-entered word mode, the user will enter the word to be used on the screen.  In the second mode, the user can choose from a list of categories and a random word related to that category will be selected.  If an incorrect letter is selected, a piece of the robot is added, and if the robot is built before they have completed the word, they lose.  If they complete the word before the robot is built, they win!
